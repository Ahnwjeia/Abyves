This location is anything but a bar. The illumination is dim, the air cold, reeking of metal. There is a collection of rough tables and chairs on the balcony, overseeing the huge atrium-like space. If not for the swarms of drones passing by and causing drafts, this spot would be perfect to wind down and enjoy the solitude and silence.
Some tables are nestled beneath screens hanging from the wall where the balcony sprouts from. They look vaguely like workstations and on one there is even a TriPad being hooked up with a screen. There is a small fridge between the screens on the wall, next to the balcony railing almost looking like a counter.

Standing here and gazing at some distant, barely illuminated balconies, humanoid shapes can be seen. They look heavily modified with metal augments and some barely sport a head. The longer you look at them, the more they seem to move in unison with each other - just like the swarms above you.

One flies by and you turn around to look back at the bar-like establishment.",,
