This rogue Domain-era cryosleeper is seemingly stranded in the Orion-Perseus Abyss. Its hull shows comb-like surfaces with openings for ships. The whole structure looks more suited as a staging ground for ship building and trading, rather than for transporting people.",,"After passing the comb-like structures and being able to behold this cryosleeper from within, it’s clear this hull has been modified and corrupted by new inhabitants. While still having docking ports compatible with your ship, the main atrium-like space is covered with balconies. Swarms of hand-sized metallic objects are lapping against the walls as if cleaning the surfaces. These flocking machines are the only sign of occupation.",,,
